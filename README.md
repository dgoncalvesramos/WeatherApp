A Weather App developped in java with  [javaFX](https://openjfx.io/) interface. It shows the current local time, temperature, the wind speed and the description of the current weather. To use it you need to suscribe to the [openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/) and replace in config.properties file the variable API_KEY with your Key. It is free of charge under 1000 API calls per day.
